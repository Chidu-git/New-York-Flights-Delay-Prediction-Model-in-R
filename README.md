# New-York-Flights-Delay-Prediction-Model-in-R
Predicting the flight delays that depart from three major airports in New York City in year 2013. 
The project involves analyzing the data, selecting the essential data and various methodologies implemented to predict the flight delay. Explanation regarding the dataset, the criterion of selecting the data and prediction models implemented, has been done section wise. 
In the later sections, results are explained. 
The project report also contains an appendix which includes ‘.rmd’ code used for prediction in the project.
